### Adding New Components

1. Create the component in the appropriate folder:
   - `src/components/atoms/` for basic elements
   - `src/components/molecules/` for compound components
   - `src/components/organisms/` for complex components

2. Export from the component's `index.ts`:

   ```tsx
   export * from './ComponentName';
   ```

3. Export from the category's `index.ts`:

   ```tsx
   export * from './ComponentName';
   ```

4. Export from the main `index.ts`:
   ```tsx
   export * from './components';
   ```
